# Appendix MA 2024

In this repository, I have two files: CoAP and MQTT. These files contain summarized logs from my testbed, which are part of my research. These two files do not contain all the logs; they only include summaries of all outputs and logs for my master's thesis.

MoreoverAdditionally, due to page limitations in my paper, I included the exploit used in this repository, which explains the customized exploit and also represents the exploit used from other research and white papers.
