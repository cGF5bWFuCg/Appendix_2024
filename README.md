# Appendix MA 2024

In this repository, I have included two files: CoAP and MQTT. These files contain summarized logs from my testbed, which are integral to my research. Please note that these files do not encompass all the logs; they merely provide summaries of all outputs and logs relevant to my master's thesis.

Additionally, due to page limitations in my paper, I have documented the exploit used in this repository. This documentation not only explains the customized exploit but also describes how this exploit is derived from other research and white papers. Furthermore, it details how I detect this attack from the logs.
