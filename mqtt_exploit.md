## Connect Flooding
https://github.com/gianluca2414/MQTT_SlowITe

The attack mechanism involves dispatching a surge of MQTT CONNECT packets, which are the initial packets in the MQTT protocol used to establish a connection between the client and the broker.

## Last Will Payload

The attack mechanism simulates a test condition for the broker to handle connections and Last Will messages from a large number of clients rapidly connecting and disconnecting. 

### Requirements
+ This attack is simulated using Python 3.11.8.
+ In the attack, three libraries are imported
    * __paho.mqtt.client__: This library is essential for MQTT communication, enabling the creation and management of MQTT client connections, publishing messages, and subscribing to topics. To install this module click [hier](https://eclipse.dev/paho/index.php?page=clients/python/index.php).
    * __time__: This standard Python library is used for its sleep function, which introduces delays in this case, 0.1 seconds between client connections and disconnections, effectively simulating rapid client turnover and testing the broker's handling of last will messages.
    * __random__: The library is also imported but not used in the given code snippet
